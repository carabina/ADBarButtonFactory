ADBarButtonFactory
==================

Since iOS 7, it's been crazy to try to change the "highlighted" color of bar button items. Fortunately, we can still create background images for the Normal and Highlighted states of UIBarButtonItems. This project is a workaround that converts UILabels into images to use for these background images so that we can still get nice font rendering.
